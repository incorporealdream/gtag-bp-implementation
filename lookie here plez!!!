JUST A DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT ISNT MEANT TO BE GOOD. ITS A SIMPLE PASSION PROJECT IM MAKING FOR THE SHITS N GIGGLES. FUCK OFF WITH THE ANGRY 'WAH WAH WAH YOU MADE THIS SO WRONG YOU FUCKING SUCK!!' JUST TELL ME AND ILL FIX IT BRO. NOT THAT SRS I PROMISE :SOB:

Hey, just here to give an easy header on what do for this lib
https://buttplug-csharp.docs.buttplug.io/api/  <--- that site would be a good read before you try to change anything or implement events (i'm not very good please try to commit a change should you see something that is unoptimized)
Im genuinely horrible at doing server to client connections and porting; if you see issues with how I implemented it tell me, I will actively check on comments. (it isn't necessarily actual client -> server, just the device connections n shit im bad at :sob:)
oh right, https://docs.buttplug.io/docs/dev-guide/  is also a good place to look at before you try and criticize my lib n shit :D
