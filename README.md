# gtag-bp-implementation
bleh :3

this is an attempt at making a plugin/lib for the BepInEx modification of hit monkey game, gorilla tag.

(attempting to implement *b*.*ttpl*.*g*/*s.xtoy* interactives based upon ingame events)

goofy little side project I felt would be funny ig. 

this is likely going to moreso be a lib or refrence for other plugins to use instead of a plugin itself.

have fun with this, get it down in freaky town, hell yeah.

this is going to be built off of the BP-C# distributable, and will act as a bridge between it and the gorilla tag code.

(the PANDA3DS emulator pull req. made my brain think that this would be pure hilarity)

unfortunately for any freaky person who wants to look at this, the code n shit is private till i at least have something decent :P
